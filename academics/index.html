Instead, economics has become an increasingly ubiquitous as well as rapidly changing line of inquiry that requires people who are skilled in analyzing and interpreting economic data, and then using it to effect decisions about national and global markets and policy, involving everything from health care to\u00a0fiscal policy, from foreign aid to the environment, from the economics of defense to the economics of the law, and from financial risk to real risk.<\/p>\n<p>Advances in computing and the greater availability of timely data through the Internet have created an arena that demands skilled statistical analysis, guided by economic reasoning and modeling. This combination is in high demand by government agencies, congressional committees, international lending institutions, trade associations, private businesses, including those in the financial services sector, and private consulting firms.<b>\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The MS in applied economics is a 10-course\u00a0degree program offered evenings at the Washington, D.C., center of the Johns Hopkins University (near Dupont Circle). It can be pursued at a part-time or full-time pace. All undergraduate majors are welcome; not all\u00a0of\u00a0our students have\u00a0majored in economics. Admissions are rolling, and one can begin any summer, fall, or spring semester.<\/p>\n<p>The program develops skill in economic reasoning, and in formulating and estimating economic models through the use of econometrics and other quantitative techniques. This is accomplished by a rigorous and demanding curriculum, and a talented and dedicated staff of instructors. The foundation for intelligent economic reasoning is laid with microeconomic and macroeconomic theory and policy; in turn, statistics and econometrics lay the foundation for empirical analysis. Econometric skills are deepened by taking an advanced econometrics course, either microeconometrics or macroeconometrics.

Advances in chemistry will be required to meet global challenges of clean air, safe water, healthy food, dependable medicine, advanced materials, eco-friendly products, and sustainable energy.<\/p>\n<p>Our understanding of the fundamental nature of the world is grounded in chemistry. Molecular transformations are central to the production of food, medicines, fuel, and a countless array of materials. Chemists seek to understand the fundamental nature of matter and the changes it undergoes on a molecular or atomic level. While this goal was once limited almost exclusively to chemists, there is an increased effort toward molecular-level characterization in most areas of science and technology.

In practice, students will find that the \"hard\" side of history (demographic and economic history, and certain aspects of social history as well) mixes quite well with the \"soft\" side, with its emphasis on cultural and intellectual history.<\/p>\n"},"filtering":{"degrees":[{"term_id":676,"name":"Doctoral","slug":"doctoral","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":676,"taxonomy":"degrees","description":"","parent":false,"count":72,"filter":"raw","icon":"fa-fw fa-medkit"},{"term_id":673,"name":"Major","slug":"major","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":673,"taxonomy":"degrees","description":"","parent":{"term_id":672,"name":"Bachelor's","slug":"bachelors","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":672,"taxonomy":"degrees","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},"count":57,"filter":"raw","icon":"fa-fw i-major major"},{"term_id":675,"name":"Master's","slug":"masters","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":675,"taxonomy":"degrees","description":"","parent":false,"count":123,"filter":"raw","icon":"fa-fw fa-briefcase"},{"term_id":674,"name":"Minor","slug":"minor","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":674,"taxonomy":"degrees","description":"","parent":{"term_id":672,"name":"Bachelor's","slug":"bachelors","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":672,"taxonomy":"degrees","description":"","parent":0,"count":2,"filter":"raw"},"count":41,"filter":"raw","icon":"fa-fw i-minor minor"}],"frequency":[{"term_id":690,"name":"Full-time","slug":"full-time","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":690,"taxonomy":"frequency","description":"","parent":false,"count":175,"filter":"raw","icon":"fa-hourglass"}],"type":[{"term_id":687,"name":"In-person","slug":"in-person","term_group":0,"term_taxonomy_id":687,"taxonomy":"field_of_study_type","description":"","parent":false,"count":217,"filter":"raw","icon":"fa-user"}]},"type":"field_of_study","displayData":{"divisions":{"slugs":["school-of-arts-and-sciences"],"names":["Krieger School of Arts and Sciences"]},"icons":[{"icon":"fa-fw fa-medkit","description":"Doctoral"},{"icon":"fa-fw i-major major","description":"Major"},{"icon":"fa-fw fa-briefcase","description":"Master's"},{"icon":"fa-fw i-minor minor","description":"Minor"},{"icon":"fa-hourglass","description":"Full-time"},{"icon":"fa-user","description":"In-person"}],"classes":["school-of-arts-and-sciences","doctoral","major","bachelors","masters","minor","bachelors","full-time","in-person"]}}</script>

We seek to provide trainees with the ability to identify significant research questions in Immunology, to find solutions to these questions, to think broadly and creatively about biological problems, and to communicate ideas effectively to others. Our goal is to train the next generation of Immunologists who, through active scholarship contribute to the generation of new knowledge on the basic mechanisms of the immune system and the application of this knowledge to the understanding and treatment of disease. We accomplish this mission by selecting and supporting qualified trainees, providing relevant didactic coursework and through the participation of highly qualified faculty who are skilled mentors and accomplished researchers in Immunology.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Close interaction with faculty and a high faculty\/student ratio are important features of the program.
